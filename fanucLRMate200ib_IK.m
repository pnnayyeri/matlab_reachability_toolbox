        %   limits are required, they should be provided as infinite, i.e [-inf
        %   inf] for each joint. The default behaviors are as follows:

        %        rotation amounts are achievable and the rotation is distributed

        %        joints are centered within their range.

        %        some total rotation amounts may not be feasible and the rotation
        %        is distributed as much as possible on the distal joints (unused

%solveFirstThreeDHJoints Solve for the first three joint angles of a DH-parameterized robot
%   This function computes the first three joint angles of a robot
%   parameterized using Denavit-Hartenberg parameters. The function accepts
%   a matrix of the fixed DH parameters, as well as the position of the
%   fifth joint. The matrix of DH parameters is of size 6x4 for the 6
%   non-fixed joints, where each row has the order [a alpha d 0], where a
%   is a translation along x, alpha is a rotation about x, and d is a
%   translation along z. The last value, which typically refers to theta
%   (the rotation about z) for that joint, is not yet known; this function
%   will solve for theta for the first three joints. When a robot has the
%   last three axes intersecting, the position and orientation of the end
%   effector can be split up: the position is entirely determined by the
%   first three joints, while the orientation is governed by the last three
%   joints (provided the first three are known). Furthermore, the position
%   of any end effector can be related to the position of the fifth joint
%   frame, which corresponds to the joint frame at the midpoint of the
%   three intersecting joints. This frame will have the same position in
%   any valid solution to the particular IK problem (though its orientation
%   may differ), and its translation relative to the base frame is entirely
%   defined by the first three joints. This function solves for those first
%   three joints given the position of the joint 5 frame relative to the

% solve the polynomial for h and map the solutions back to theta3.
